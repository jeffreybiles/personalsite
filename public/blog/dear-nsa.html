<p>Dear NSA,</p>

<p>Attached you will find my application for the position of American Watcher.
I have been an American Watcher for most of my life, although you cannot find it on my resume since, like you, I have been very secretive.
My ex-wife didn't know I was tracking her through her phone for the entire three months of our marriage, until some goddam whistleblower made her aware of my security efforts.  I am sure this rogue actor is some sort of terrorist.  Not only has he dared to speak about my security apparatus, but he is in league with at least one woman, my ex-wife, who has terrorized my heart and devastated my homeland.
More recently, I have been conducting surveillance on the neighborhood teenage girls.  While their terroristic tendencies have not been fully revealed, this should not stop me at all.  Why should they mind that I watch them, as long as they have nothing to hide.  Nothing to hide behind those frilly, foreign-made panties.
Silencing dissent and intimidating peaceful protesters is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to how we can use your technology.  Just let me in, and I'll make sure your technology gets used to the climax of its potential.
You don't even have to pay me.</p>

<p>--Tom</p>
