<h1>I LIKE TO MOVE IT MOVE IT</h1>
<p>Let's get started right away.  And to facilitate that, we're going to take part of our code temporarily back to the dark ages (aka, no list comprehensions).</p>

<p>First, click on the screen so that it will pick up your commands.  Then, press and hold one of the arrow keys.  Or many of them at once.</p>
<p>You see that?  That's the first step on the way to making our game interactive.</p>
<p>You'll notice that a <b>lot</b> of code has been added.  The good news is that this code can be used practically verbatim
  in any project where you require interaction of this sort.  This means that we don't have to go over it as painstakingly as we did the code in the last installment.</p>
<p>Still, there are some basics you need to be aware of.  First, each key on the keyboard has a number.  For example, 37 is 'left'.
  There are two different events that the keyboard can fire: keyup and keydown.  As you can guess, when you press a button keyup is fired,
  and when you release a button keydown is fired.</p>
<p>What we're doing is whenever keydown is fired, we add that key to a list.  When keyup is fired, we take it off that list.
  The list is of every key that is currently being pressed.</p>
<p>And what, exactly, is firing anyways?  It's something the browser sends to your code.</p>
<p><i>It is okay if you don't understand anything in this section.</i>  I didn't get everything until the third or fourth time I used this code.
  The point is, copy the code and look into it more if you need to change it.</p>
  <p>For the rest of the time we can safely ignore all that messy keyboard code.  To signal that, I'm going to put it at the bottom.
    I'm also going to take our code back up to modernity by reimplementing list comprehensions.  Now, on to better things!</p>

<h2>Play York Lass</h2>
  <p>What we want now is to be able to control one circle but have the rest bouncing around randomly.  The first attempt we'll make will work, but is incredibly naive:
  <iframe style="width: 100%; height: 300px" src="http://jsfiddle.net/2vNsz/77/embedded/result,js" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>
  <p>We made two classes:  Circle (using our code from part 2) and Player(using our code from just now).  This works, but you'll notice that
  the 'move' and 'draw' functions are <i>exactly the same</i>.  That's because Player is a special type of Circle.</p>
  <p>In coffeescript (and other object-oriented languages) there is a the concept of a "subclass".  Basically, you take the functionality
  of one class and change it.  Here's the same thing, but with Player existing as a subclass of Circle.</p>
  <iframe style="width: 100%; height: 300px" src="http://jsfiddle.net/2vNsz/76/embedded/js,result" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>
  <p>You'll notice that Player only has functions for 'constructor' and 'update'.  That's because, as we said before, 'draw' and 'move' are exactly
  the same for Player and Circle.  If the computer doesn't find a function in the subclass (Player) it will look for it in the superclass (Circle).
  You just saved lots of code!  It gets even better when you have multiple subclasses, and in case you're wondering, we will eventually have
  subclasses for Player, Enemy, and Bullet.</p>

<h2>Cull Her, Soup Her</h2>
  <p>In case you were wondering, <b>no</b>, we haven't fully explored the power of classes yet.  We want to have players
    and enemies to be different colors, and to that we will use a tool called 'super'.</p>
