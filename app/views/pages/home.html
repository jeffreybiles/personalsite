    <p>I am interested in <span class="expander"><span class="expandable">web development, </span><span class="expansion">designing interactive web applications and games using <span class="expander"><span class="expandable">the latest tools. </span><span class="expansion">Ruby, Rails, Javascript/Coffeescript, Node.js, Canvas, and whatever else I need to get the job done. </span></span>My other interests are </span></span>entrepreneurship, <span class="expander"><span class="expandable">education, and <a href="http://jeffreybiles.com/games/">game design</a> </span><span class="expansion">education, and <a href="http://jeffreybiles.com/games/">game design</a>. These last two fields, when practiced well, have a <span class="expander"><span class="expandable">surprising amount in common </span><span class="expansion">focus on challenging and increasing the skills of the learner/player. Games do this very well for skills of limited use.
