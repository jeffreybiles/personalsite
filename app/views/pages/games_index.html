            <h3>Tribulate</h3>
    </a>
            <p>My biggest, baddest game.  Baddest in both senses.  View it more as a tech demo, showing that I can
                do complicated personalized persistence in Rails.
            <p>It's halfway between a choose-your-own-adventure story and a role-playing game.</p>
            <p>Requires either login or facebook connection.</p>

            <p>You could view it as a treatise on the senselessness of violence.
            <p>You could also view it as a series of fun twists on the space shooter concept.</p>

            <h3>Electras</h3>
    </a>
        <p>A game meant to teach kids the basics of circuits.  It also doubles as a fun puzzler.</p>
        <p>This one was a team effort, led by <a href="http://ozark.hendrix.edu/~burch/">Carl Burch</a> of Hendrix College.
        My part was in level design, tutorial creation/display, and internationalization support, as well as consulting
            and troubleshooting other parts of the program.

        <p><h5><i>Note:  There have been considerable... changes... to the game's code since I last touched it.</i></h5>

            <p>If I were trapped on a desert island and could only blatantly rip off one 80's educational game...
            <p>You can also play the first (less complicated) iteration:

        <p>Atomic* gladiators. Now with contradictory and outdated physics.
        <p>*No atoms were harmed in the making of this game.
        <p>Originally made for Ludum Dare 23, scored in the top 10% for innovation and fun, and the top 20% for humor.
            I'm not really sure how that last part happened.</p>
